# Exercise 12.11: Direct Redis Access Using redis-cli

# 1. Go to the Redis container and access the redis-cli:
# Run the following command to enter the Redis container and start the Redis CLI:
docker exec -it redis redis-cli

# 2. Check all the keys in Redis:
# To list all keys in the Redis database, run:
KEYS *

# 3. Check the value of the key (e.g., `todos_count`):
# To check the value of the key `todos_count` (or your relevant counter), run:
GET todos_count

# 4. Set the value of the counter to 9001:
# Update the counter value to 9001 using the SET command:
SET todos_count 9001

# 5. Verify the new counter value:
# Ensure the new value has been set by checking it again:
GET todos_count

# 6. Refresh the statistics page to ensure the new value works:
# Open the statistics page in your browser: 
# http://localhost:3000/statistics

# 7. Create a new todo using Postman:
# Send a POST request to add a new todo (http://localhost:3000/todos) with Postman.

# 8. Check Redis to ensure the counter has been incremented:
# Go back to the Redis CLI and check the counter value:
GET todos_count

# 9. Delete the key from Redis to test the behavior of the counter:
# To delete the key `todos_count`:
DEL todos_count

# 10. Add a new todo again using Postman to ensure the counter works properly:
# Add a new todo again via Postman.

# 11. Verify that the counter is automatically updated:
# Run the GET command on Redis to check the new value of the counter:
GET todos_count
