Exercise 12.2: Containerizing the Todo Backend Application

Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to containerize the `todo-backend` Node.js application using Docker. This involves creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, and running the container.

Steps to Complete the Exercise:

1. **Create a Dockerfile for `todo-backend`:**
   - A `Dockerfile` was created in the `todo-app/todo-backend` directory to define the environment for the application.
   - The `Dockerfile` contains the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
   FROM node:16

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install the application's dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application files
   COPY . .

   # Expose port 3000
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Define the command to run the application
   CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
